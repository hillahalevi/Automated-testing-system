# Automated-testing-system
an automated testing system to compile run and compare c files

ex31 has the comparing logic so it needs to be compiled befor use and get the name = cmp.out
ex31 gets two paths of files and check for comparsent.

ex32 defines the testing system : get a confogoration file which defines 3 paths: students directory,input,and right output
the program will then search for each student a c file compile and run it with the input and then using the cmp.out check with the
right output.
the reuslts are written to a reasults.csv file.

#files #system calls #threads
